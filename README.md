# NewtonRapshonAsmx86
An Assembly x86 program to find a single root of a polynomial of complex coefficients using Newton-Raphson method

The program reads from the sdtin  
sample input:  
  epsilon = 1.0e-9  
  order = 2  
  coeff 2 = 3.0 1.0 ( representes 3 + i)  
  coeff 1 = 2.0 0.0 ( 2 )  
  coeff 0 = 6.0 2.5 ( 6 + 2.5i)  
  initial = 1.0 -1.0 (our approximation of the root)
